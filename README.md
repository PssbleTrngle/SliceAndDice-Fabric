### Slicer

This mod enables a variety of features to create better compatibility between mostly [Farmer's Delight][FARMERS_DELIGHT_FABRIC] and [Create][CREATE_FABRIC].
While it is designed to work with Farmer's Delight, it does work without it and also adds some compatibility features for other mods.

### Automatic Cutting

The Main feature of the mod is the _Slicer_, a machine similar to the _Mechanical Mixer_ or _Mechanical Press_ from Create.
It automatically registers all cutting recipes from Farmer's Delight. In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  
In order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`. 
By default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.
An example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)

### Automatic Cooking

All recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.
